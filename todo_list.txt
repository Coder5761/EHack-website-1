1.DONE show a map (https://developer.tomtom.com/maps-sdk-web-js/functional-examples#examples,map,vector-map.html) 
2.DELETED 
3.DONE get all possible data about any segment on the road (https://developer.tomtom.com/maps-sdk-web-js/functional-examples#examples,map,traffic-flow-segments.html) 
4. simulate traffic flow from one marker to another for some roads between them. Add area property to markers and brute force roads inside it? 

First idea for simulation:
array of points - cars on the roads. 
//We don't need any cell simulation, b/c there are clusters, which calculate the amount of our cars automaticly
(TODO) Init positions of cars as random inside one city
loop:
  all we need is request data about flow of every road segment on cars poses and then move the car to next pos with the correlation of time and data
  //DONE request
  //IN PROGRESS move
  //TODO correlation of time
  //TODO correlation of data
endloop

Possible problems: too much requests! wont it use full amount of free transactions?
