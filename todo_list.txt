1.DONE show a map (https://developer.tomtom.com/maps-sdk-web-js/functional-examples#examples,map,vector-map.html) 
2.IN PROGRESS draw one circular marker whith a digit inside (https://developer.tomtom.com/maps-sdk-web-js/functional-examples#examples,map,markers-clustering.html) 
3.DONE get all possible data about any segment on the road (https://developer.tomtom.com/maps-sdk-web-js/functional-examples#examples,map,traffic-flow-segments.html) 
4. simulate traffic flow from one marker to another for some roads between them. Add area property to markers and brute force roads inside it? 

First idea for simulation:
array of points - cars on the roads. 
//We don't need any cell simulation, b/c there are clusters, which calculate the amount of our cars automaticly
Init positions of cars as random inside one city
loop:
  all we need is request data about flow of every road segment on cars poses and then move the car to next pos with the correlation of time and data
endloop

Possible problems: too much requests! wont it use full amount of free transactions?
